# Laptop-price-Estimator
Calculate the price of laptop according to your specification

**Description:**
Buying a laptop is a decision almost all of us have made at some time. Each of us tries to have the best equipment at the lowest possible price, but it is known that more expensive components make the price of the equipment increase. But which component affects the price the most? Using the laptop database, we will try to answer this question by exploring and creating a model of Machine Learning (regression, because we predict the price) explaining the price of the laptop depending on its components. We will try to estimate what influences the price of the finished set the most and how accurately we are able to estimate laptop prices based on its components.

**Tool Used:** Python | pandas | numpy | matplotlib | seaborn | Machine learning model | Scikit Learn
